# XSLT Extension

This extension is intended to be loaded in Dev mode. It detects differences between native and polyfill xslt results.

## Improvements / Bugs

If you find issues with this extension, feel free to file a bug [here](https://github.com/mfreed7/xslt_extension/issues). Note that if the problem is with the polyfill (i.e. a site doesn't render correctly) you should probably file a bug on the [polyfill repo](https://github.com/mfreed7/xslt_polyfill/issues) directly. Even better, if you would like to contribute to this extension,
I'm happy to review [pull requests](https://github.com/mfreed7/xslt_extension/pulls). Thanks in advance!
